Each rabbit has 6 textures:
	BackLeg
	Down
	FrontLeg
	Nom
	Up
	Ear

Each rabbit has 5 states:
	Standing
	Sitting
	Eating
	Ear flopped
	Walking

Each rabbit also has:
	A direction it is facing
	An x position
	A y position
	A cycle number for eating or walking or getting bored

Texture is:
	When walking, texture cycles between Up, FrontLeg, BackLeg
	When standing, texture is Up
	When ear is flopped, texture is Ear
	When sitting, texture is Down
	When eating, texture alternates between Down and Nom
	Texture is flipped based on direction facing

Transition logic is:
	When walking and texture is Up:
		there is a 1/4 chance to stop walking
		moving left at x < 16 stops walking
		moving right at x > 104 stops walking
	When walking:
		x changes by between 2 and 4 in the direction facing
		there is a 2/5 chance to try to move vertically:
			half of attempts move up and succeed if y > 0
			half of attempts move down and succeed if y < 80
	When standing:
		A random number between 0 and 19 is chosen, and if that is less than the number of cycles since standing started, then one of four things happens randomly:
			start sitting
			turn around
			flop ear
			start walking
	When ear is flopped:
		A random number between 0 and 19 is chosen, and if that is less than the number of cycles since standing started, then start standing
	When sitting:
		A random number between 0 and 19 is chosen, and if that is less than the number of cycles since sitting started, then:
			1/3 of the time, start standing
			2/3 of the time, start earing
	When eating:
		A random number between 0 and 49 is chosen, and if that is less than the number of cycles since eating started, then start sitting

Rabbits are initialised with:
	Random x position between 20 and 91
	Random y position between 16 and 61
	Random direction facing
	Standing

Screen is:
